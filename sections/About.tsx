              Hello! My name is Yushaku and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web
              development started back in 2020 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking
              together a custom blog button taught me a lot about HTML and CSS!
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast-forward to today, and I have had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a
              huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible,
              inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API
              using Node and React.
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few technologies I have been working with recently:</p>
            <ul className="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-8">
              {programmingLanguage.map((Language) => (
                <li key={Language.id} className="flex gap-1 items-center justify-center text-[19px]">
                  <Image src={Language.iconLink} alt="icon" width={25} height={25} />
                  {Language.title}
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div className="right relative z-10 h-[400px] cursor-pointer ">
            <div className="group absolute top-[6.5%] left-[8.9%]  flex items justify-center">
              <Image src="/yushaku2.jpg" className="z-10 object-contain mt-2 rounded-full" width={350} height={350} />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
